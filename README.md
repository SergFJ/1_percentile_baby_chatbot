# 👶 1 Percentile Baby Chatbot

A personal data project to help concerned parents explore medical research papers about 1 percentile babies through an AI-powered chatbot.

## 📌 Why This Project?

As a parent of a 1 percentile baby, I understand the stress and the endless questions that come with it. This project is both a personal passion and a professional learning journey as I transition from Data Analyst to Data Engineer and ultimately to Machine Learning Engineer.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Collect and explore open-access medical research related to low-percentile baby growth and development.
- ✅ Create a structured data pipeline to store, clean, and organize these papers.
- ✅ Use machine learning (NLP) to build a chatbot that can answer questions using scientific literature.
- ✅ Deploy a free, open-source app that other concerned parents can use.
